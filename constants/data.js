      "Sales Engineer with a strong interest in hardware design",
    description: [
      `With a background in cloud operations engineering I have experience developing and deploying large scale applications with an emphasis on reliability and performance. I have carried these skills over to the sales side as well: using my knowledge of SRE principles to sell monitoring solutions to a wide variety of organizations ranging from eCommerce platforms, to Finance and Healthcare`,
      `Despite my experience in the software realm, I also have a penchant for product design in the physical world. I have taught myself 3D modeling using Fusion360 and have brought these models into reality using my 3D printer. Beyond the design of the models themselves, I will frequently construct projects that involve some kind of electronic hardware (e.g. Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc.). Everything from the soldering of wires and PCBs to the design of the software, I do it all. Sometimes with great success and sometimes with less success: but all of which provides for a valuable learning experience.`,
      `Beyond these pursuits, I spend a great deal of my spare time DJ'ing and producing music. My wife and I host a monthly radio show on Eaton Radio here in D.C., and I play live around the area as well (mainly doing all-vinyl sets). I mainly make my own music within Ableton, but do also enjoy using hardware synthesizersocassionally (namely my Yamaha SY77 FM synthesizer).`,
